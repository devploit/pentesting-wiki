# Juicy Potato

Juicy potato is basically a weaponized version of the RottenPotato exploit that exploits the way Microsoft handles tokens. Through this, we achieve privilege escalation. The exploit allows us to escalate from service accounts in session 0 to SYSTEM. More to come once I understand it all!

### How it works?

The only real requirement however, is that the account has the `SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege` and/or `SeImpersonatePrivilege` which most service accounts do have.

```csharp
C:\Windows\Temp\JuicyPotato.exe -p cmd.exe -a "/c whoami > C:\Users\Public\hax0r.txt" -t * -l 1031 -c {d20a3293-3341-4ae8-9aaf-8e397cb63c34}
```
